# Software Engineer Intern at Sport Sitters

## TL;DR

Led a fast-paced migration and refactor of a janky mobile MVP, converted 30k+ lines of JS to TypeScript, upgraded React Native, rebuilt the admin portal from the ground up, and stabilized production while shipping features across frontend and backend in cross-functional sprints.

---

## Role & responsibilities

- Title: Software Engineer Intern
- Core responsibilities:
  - Upgrade and modernize legacy React Native mobile app.
  - Migrate codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, driving modularity and maintainability.
  - Rebuild the admin platform to provide full operational control and analytics.
  - Maintain production stability during aggressive feature work.
  - Work closely with product, design, and backend teams across rapid sprints.

## Project journal — structured by major workstreams

### 1) Emergency migration & stabilization (Weeks 0–3)

Problem:

- The MVP used React Native 0.71 and many deprecated dependencies that caused frequent crashes.
- Codebase was large, untyped, and difficult to maintain.

Work done:

- Upgraded RN 0.71 → 0.74 to restore compatibility with key libraries and Expo.
- Migrated core app from JavaScript to TypeScript incrementally.
- Converted ~30,000+ lines of JS to TS with a focus on safe typing and modular boundaries.
- Replaced or patched unstable 3rd-party deps; audited ~50 packages and standardized versions.

Impact:

- Reduced runtime crashes and improved developer velocity.
- Enabled safer refactors and type-driven confidence for future work.

### 2) Modular refactor & architecture

Approach:

- Introduced clear module boundaries (services, UI components, navigation, state).
- Centralized API contracts and types to minimize brittle integrations.
- Converted Redux usage to typed actions/selectors where possible.

Outcome:

- Smaller, testable modules and fewer cross-cutting side effects.
- Faster onboarding for other developers and easier code reviews.

### 3) Admin platform rebuild

Scope:

- Entirely rebuilt the admin portal (Next.js + React) for operators and moderators.

Features:

- Full user management: view/edit users, account status, and activity logs.
- Booking oversight: search, filter, and manage bookings and refunds (Stripe integration).
- Moderation tools: view messages flagged by Perspective API, suspend accounts, and audit trails.
- Analytics & insights: revenue dashboards, engagement metrics, and churn indicators.
- Intuitive chat UI with clear visual hierarchy to speed moderator actions.

Impact:

- Admins gained end-to-end operational control and reliable auditability.
- Faster triage and moderation reduced response time for incidents.

### 4) Production safety & monitoring

- Integrated Perspective API to surface toxic content and automated moderation rules.
- Implemented structured logging and cross-service tracing (Firebase + Google Cloud).
- Added defensive code paths and graceful degradation where unstable deps existed.

Result:

- Platform remained stable during ongoing development; fewer emergency rollbacks.

### 5) Cross-functional delivery & sprint work

- Regular participation in fast two-week sprints with product and design.
- Frequent context switching: shipped UI features, designed interface flows, debugged serverless functions, and iterated on admin UX.
- Prioritized “keep the lights on” tasks while delivering major improvements.

---

## Metrics & impact (examples recruiters care about)

- ~30k lines migrated to TypeScript in the first months.
- Admin portal rebuilt → reduced average moderation time by an estimated 40% (operational observation).
- Crash rate reduced after RN upgrade and dependency consolidation (qualitative and monitoring-backed).
- Faster iteration: new feature lead times shortened due to modular architecture and types.

---

## Challenges & learnings

- Challenge: Migrating a large untyped codebase while keeping production running.
  - Approach: Incremental typing, strict test/monitoring, and staged rollouts.
- Challenge: Dealing with many deprecated packages.
  - Approach: Audit, patch, or replace; where replacement wasn’t available, added defensive checks.
- Learning: Prioritizing developer experience (types, modular code) pays off immediately in velocity and reliability.

---

## Notable contributions

- RN upgrade to 0.74 and Expo compatibility fixes.
- Full JS → TS migration of core mobile codebase (30k+ lines).
- Rebuilt admin portal with moderation, billing, and analytics UI.
- Integration of Perspective API for safer chat.
- End-to-end ownership: from UI design adjustments to backend function fixes.
