# Software Engineer Intern at Sport Sitters

A short, focused summary of my work at Sport Sitters. I led cross-functional efforts to stabilize and modernize the product, improve developer velocity, and rebuild the tooling needed for operations and moderation.

Key contributions:

- Modernized the mobile codebase and reduced production instability.
- Rebuilt the admin/operations tooling to support moderation, billing, and user management.
- Improved observability and safety by adding monitoring and automated moderation aids.

Impact:

- Stabilized production and shortened iteration cycles for new features.
- Enabled clearer ownership and faster onboarding through modular architecture.
